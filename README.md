## Hi, I am Navaneeth D
Tenacious and meticulous undergraduate at Government Engineering College Thrissur, pursuing B.tech degree program in Computer Science and Engineering.

Right from the start I have always been excited about the way data drives the world. This very excitement gave me the right head-start in my quest for learning more about the world of Data Science and Machine Learning. Throughout the years, I have honed my skills in Data science and Machine Learning and have also analysed several real world datasets, gaining mastery over several popular python libraries like Numpy, Pandas and data visualization tools like Matplotlib, seaborn, ploty and others.

I am also a writer at Analytics Vidhya and have made several publications on medium. I have experience working with several programming languages like C, Python, R, Java and with operating systems including various Linux distributions and Windows.
